# treezjs
**Treez** is an open source project that helps you to create **tree based Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)** for (scientific) web applications. The core idea of treez is to provide reusable building blocks (so-called **atoms**) and to organize them in a **tree model**. The tree model can be edited with a **tree view**. It can also be exported to and imported from a JavaScript **code editor**. The code can be stored as text file. 

Treez originally has been developed as Eclipse Plugin (see https://github.com/stefaneidelloth/treez). This github project provides  a **JavaScript implementation of Treez (= treezjs)**. All further development is done here.
