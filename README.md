# treezjs
Treez is an open source project that helps you to create tree based Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) for (scientific) web applications. The core idea of treez is to provide reusable building blocks (so-called atoms) and to organize them in a tree structure.

Treez originally has been developed as Eclipse Plugin (see https://github.com/stefaneidelloth/treez). This github project provides  a JavaScript implementation of Treez (= treezjs). All further development will be done here.
