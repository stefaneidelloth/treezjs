# treezjs
Treez is an open source project that helps you to create tree based Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) for (scientific) applications.
The core idea of treez is to provide reusable building blocks (so-called atoms) and to organize them in a tree structure.

Originally Treez has been developed as Eclipse Plugin (see https://github.com/stefaneidelloth/treez). This is a JavaScript version of Treez (= treezjs) and all further development will be done here.
