The atoms that come with treez by default represent a typical modelling workflow for scientific applications: 
First you define a model, then you run some studies and finaly you process and evaluate the results. If the
existing atoms are not yeat sufficient for your needs, you might want to [implement your custom atoms](./howToImplementAtoms.md).
