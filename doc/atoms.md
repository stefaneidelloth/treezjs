# Atoms

The atoms that come with treez by default represent a typical **modelling workflow** for scientific applications: 
First you define a model, then you define and run some studies and finally you process and evaluate the results. If the
existing atoms are not sufficient for your needs, you might want to [implement custom atoms](./atoms/howToImplementAtoms.md).
