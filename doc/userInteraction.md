# User interaction

The heart of treez is a tree view. The concept of **trees** is often used to **manage complexity** and therefore, it is not suprising that trees are a common element in complex applications. For example, the file system on your computer has a tree structure. You probably use a tree based file explorer to manage thousands of files for some complex research project. 

In order to **edit tree models**, treez focuses on **two sorts of user interaction**:

a) **context menus of tree nodes/atoms** in the so-called [**Tree View**]() and 

b) operations in the [**Properties View**](). 

Treez does not have an obfuscating main menu on the top of the application window. The clearly arranged **context menu** in the Tree View exactly provides **those actions being relevant** to the current node. This strategy of a minimalistic main menu is not a new idea. Nevertheless, the **decision to concentrate on the tree nodes** actually has a **deep impact on the workflows** and on the way one thinks about an application in treez.

Treez does not only allow to **edit an application model** with a graphical work-flow but also to edit the application model **in form of a text file** in a **Source Code Editor**. 

The graphical workflow with mouse clicks in the Tree View is easier to learn for **new users** and the source code workflow provides an efficient option for **advanced users**.
