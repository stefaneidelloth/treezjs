# User interaction

**Tree structures** are often used to **manage complexity** and therefore, tree views are a common elements in complex applications. The file system on your computer has a tree structure und you probably might use a tree based file explorer to manage thousands of files for some research projects. Treezjs also comes with a tree view. 

In order to be able to **edit tree models**, treezjs focuses on two sorts user interactions:

a) **context menus of tree nodes/atoms** in the so-called **Treez View** and 

b) operations in the **Treez Properties View**. 

Treez does not have an obfuscating main menu on the top of the application window. The clearly arranged **context menu** in the Treez View exactly provides **those actions being relevant** to the selected Treez Atom. This strategy is not a new idea. Nevertheless, the **decision to have a minimum main menu** and to concentrate on the tree nodes actually has a **deep impact on the workflows** and on the way one thinks about an application in Treez.

Treez does not only allow to **edit an application model** with a graphical work-flow but also to edit the application model **in form of a text file** in a **Source Code Editor**. 

The graphical workflow with mouse clicks in the Treez View is easier to learn for **new users** and the source code workflow provides an efficient option for **advanced users**.
