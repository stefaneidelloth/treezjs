Tree structures are often very well suited to manage complexity. Therefore, it does not surprise that trees are a common element in complex applications. The file system on computers typically has a tree structure und the reader might probably use a tree based file explorer to manage all kind of files for complex research projects. 
In order to be able to edit complex tree models, Treez focuses on the context menus of the tree nodes in the so-called Treez View and on operations in the Treez Properties View. Treez does not have an obfuscating main menu on the top of the application window. 
The context menu in the Treez View exactly provides those actions being rele-vant to the selected Treez Atom. This concept is not a new idea. Nevertheless, the decision to have a minimum main menu and to concentrate on the tree nodes actually has a deep impact on the workflows and on the way one thinks about an application in Treez.
Treez does not only allow editing an application model with a graphical work-flow but also allows editing the application model in form of a text file in a Source Code Editor. 
The graphical workflow with mouse clicks in the Treez View is easier to learn for new users and the source code workflow provides an efficient option for advanced users.
