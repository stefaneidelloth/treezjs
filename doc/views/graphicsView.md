#	Graphics View

Some of the Treez Atoms have a graphical representation, for example a plot. The purpose of the Graphics View is to show those graphical representations. 

The graphics of Treez are based on [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) and can be **interactive**. Try to click for example on the axis label of a plot to show the properties of the label in the [Properties View](./propertiesView.md). 

Also try to double click on a plot in the Graphics View to **export it** as scalable vector graphics *.svg file.
