## Treez View

The Treez View is the heart of Treez. It displays a tree model of the applica-tion and provides actions to edit the tree model. Each node of the tree repre-sents a corresponding Treez Atom. 

### Tool bar actions 
* ![addRoot](../../master/icons/root.png) Create a Root atom and set it as the content of the Treez View (overrides the previous content of the Treez View). 
* ![import](../../master/icons/toTree.png) Import a tree from the currently opened text file (overrides the previ-ous content of the Treez View). 
* ![export](../../master/icons/fromTree.png) Export the tree to the currently opened text file (overrides the pre-vious content of the text file).
 
###	Tree node mouse actions

*	Left-click: Show the properties of the corresponding Treez atom in the Properties View.
*	Right-click: Shows a context menu that provides specific actions for that tree node/atom.
*	Double-click: Fully expands or collapses the tree node.

## Properties View

The purpose of the Properties View is to inspect and edit the properties of a Treez Atom. It has a hierarchical structure: 

##	Editor View

The purpose of the Editor View is to edit the tree model of the application in form of a text file. The text file can be saved and restored and contains all modi-fied properties of the Treez Atoms.   

##	Graphics View

Some of the Treez Atoms have graphical representations, for example a plot window. The purpose of the Graphics View is to show those graphical repre-sentations.    

##	Monitoring View

The Monitoring View shows the progress of executed actions (e.g. batch simu-lations) in form of progress bars and log messages.
