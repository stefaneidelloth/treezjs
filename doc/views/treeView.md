<img align="right" width="200" src="../images/tree_view.png">

The Tree View is the heart of Treez. It displays a tree model of the application and provides actions to edit that model. Each node of the tree represents a corresponding Treez Atom. The first node of the tree is called "root". 



### Tool bar actions

* ![addRoot](../../icons/root.png) Create a Root atom and set it as the content of the Treez View (overrides the previous content of the Treez View). 
* ![import](../../icons/toTree.png) Import a tree from the currently opened text file (overrides the previ-ous content of the Treez View). 
* ![export](../../icons/fromTree.png) Export the tree to the currently opened text file (overrides the pre-vious content of the text file).
