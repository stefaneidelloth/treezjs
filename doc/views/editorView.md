#	Editor View

The purpose of the Editor View is to edit the tree model of the application in form of JavaScript code. The code can be saved and restored as text file. Generated code contains all modified properties (= different to default value) of the treez atoms.

The Editor View might look a little different, depending on how you run treez:

* Stand-alone: Line numbers are shown by default and there is some .
* Jupyter Notebook extension: The first cell of the Jupyter Notebook is used to edit treez code. You can [enable line numbers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10979667/showing-line-numbers-in-ipython-jupyter-notebooks) of the CodeMirror cells if you want. Furhter notebook cells can be added below.
