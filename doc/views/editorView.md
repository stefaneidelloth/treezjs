#	Editor View

The purpose of the Editor View is to edit the tree model of the application in form of JavaScript code. The code can be saved and restored as text file. Generated code contains all modified properties (= different to default value) of the treez atoms.

The appearance of the Editor View might be slightly different, depending on how you use treez:

* Stand-alone: Orion is used as editor and line numbers are shown by default. There is no extra border.
* Jupyter Notebook extension: The first cell of the Jupyter Notebook is used to edit the JavaScript code of treez. You can [enable line numbers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10979667/showing-line-numbers-in-ipython-jupyter-notebooks) of the CodeMirror cells if you want. Further notebook cells (containing python or some other content) can be added below. 

## Toolbar

The toolbar of the Editor View provides several action buttons:

* Open from...
* Save as...
* Open from local storage
* Save to local storage
