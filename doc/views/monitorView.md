#	Monitor View

The Monitor View shows the progress of executed actions by **progress bars** and **log messages**. 

<img src="../images/monitor_view.png">

The progress bars might show a hierarchical structure (you could call it another "tree" if you want). Click on the **triangle** symbol to expand a progress bar and to **inspect its nested progress bars**. 

You can use the progress bars to **filter the log messages**. Click on a progress bar to see its **corresponding log messages**.

If you use your mouse to **hover over a log message** you can see additional information in a pop-up window. That additional information is escpecially useful for error messages. If you would like to be get to the source code that caused the error, you can (hopefully) click on a link of the stack trace that is shown in the pop-up window of the error log message.
