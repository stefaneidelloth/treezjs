# Properties View

If you click on a node/atom in the [Tree View](./tree_view.md), the corresponding properties are shown in the Properties View. The purpose of the Properties View is to **inspect and edit the properties of a treez atom**. 

The Properties View has a hierarchical structure (you could call it "another tree" if you want):

* The topmost elements are **pages** that are shown as **tabs in a tab folder**.
* A page contains **sections**
* A section containts **input components**. A section might also contain **sub sections**. 

Each **section** has a blueish **header, sometimes including a toolbar**. If a section toolbar provides a help button and you click on that button, you will get **context specific help** for that section. Sections can be **collapsed/expanded**.

The **tree path** of the atom (that is currently inspected in the Properties View) is shown on top of the Properties View (e.g. root.results.page.graph.xy).
