# Installation

There are two ways to install and run treez:

* [Stand-alone](./standaloneInstallation.md) The stand-alone version of treez comes with its own, Java based server to access the local file system. This option does not support python based features.  
* [Jupyter notebook extension](./jupyterInstallation.md) Treez can also be installed as an extension to the Jupyter Notebook. This option connects to a python kernel to access the local file system and supports extra python features in treez.
