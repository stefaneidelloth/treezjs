		<ul>
			<li><b>Log arguments</b>: First part for specifying logging arguments. This is typically a key word
			that tells the executable that the specification of a logging file will follow, e.g. "-log" or "-l". 
			Leave this empty if your executable does not require such a logging key word.  
			</li>
			<li><b>Log file</b>: Second part for specifying logging arguments. This is typically the path
			to a logging file, e.g. "C:/log.txt". This path will not automatically be put in quotation marks 
			because some programs do not support quotation marks around the logging file path. If you use a logging
			path that contains spaces you might need to wrap it in quotation marks.Leave this empty if your executable
			does not require a log file.   	     
			</li>
