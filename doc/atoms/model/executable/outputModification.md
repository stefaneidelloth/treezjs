		<p>
		The <b>check boxes</b> in the output modification section allow to automatically modify the output file/folder that is
		specified above. This makes sense if you execute the <a class="executable"></a> atom many times, for example
		in a <a class="sweep"></a> study, and you want to have a <b>different output location for each execution</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
		The check boxes allow you to include the <b>execution date</b> and or a <b>study index</b> (=increasing number). 
		You can append them to the name of the (parent) <b>folder</b>, the name of an extra <b>sub folder</b> or to the 
		<b>file name</b> by enabling the corresponding check boxes. If you use the output modification <b>please make
		sure</b> that your executable is able to automatically create the files/folders if they do not exist. 
		</p>
		<p>
		You can manually <b>reset the study index</b> with the orange button in the upper right corner of the property page. 
		If you remotely run the <a class="executable"></a> atom as part of a study, the <b>study index</b> will be reset
		at the start and then automatically increased while executing the study.       
		<p>
		<p>
		If you are not sure how the check boxes affect the system command, have a look the status section where a preview
		for the resulting system command is shown. The status section also shows the <b>study index</b> that will be used 
		for the next manual execution. (The actual <b>execution date</b> will be different to the date that is shown in the 
		preview and the study index might be overridden when remotely running the the <a class="executable"></a> atom as 
		part of a study.)
