# Introducing Starboard Notebook
Starboard brings cell-by-cell notebooks to the browser, no code is running on the backend here!
It's probably the quickest way to visualize some data with interactivity, do some prototyping, or build a rudimentary dashboard.

#### Some features 
* Mix Markdown, $\LaTeX$, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python.
* The file format is a plaintext file, which plays nice with version control systems like git.
* Runs entirely in your browser, everything is static: no server, no setup and no build step.
* You can embed a fully functional notebook on your website.

Let's see it in action!

> Tip: Press the â–¶ Play button on the left to run a cell's code.

# %% [javascript]
// You write vanilla Javascript
const greeting = "Hello world!";

// The last statement in a cell will be displayed if it is not undefined.
greeting</script>
