## [3.0.5] - 2017-12-05

### Fixed

### Fixed
- Includes the keyboard navigation and clicking updates from 2.0.5 and 2.0.6 for React >16

## [2.0.6] - 2017-11-02

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where clicking to open & close a zoomable image resulted in the focusing of that element which could cause the page to scroll it completely into view and leave an outline on the image (aka focus) when it was not accessed via the keyboard.

## [2.0.5] - 2017-11-01

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where updating other image attributes after mounting was not respected; the image was cached in `this.state` when only the `src` should have been.

## [3.0.1] - 2017-10-20

### Fixed
- Now supporting keyboard interaction for accessibility (https://github.com/rpearce/react-medium-image-zoom/issues/70). Classified this as a bug and therefore a patch version.

## [2.0.4] - 2017-10-16

### Fixed
- Now supporting keyboard interaction for accessibility (https://github.com/rpearce/react-medium-image-zoom/issues/70). Classified this as a bug and therefore a patch version.

## [3.0.0] - 2017-10-13

### Added
- support for React v16, making use of such things as its portals concept

### Removed
- support for React < v16

## [2.0.3] - 2017-09-22

### Fixed
- `shouldRespectMaxDimension` was allowing images that were already rendered at their maximum size to be "zoomed," thus creating the issue where they don't _actually_ zoom and instead just moved to the center of the screen.

## [2.0.2] - 2017-09-21

### Fixed
- Fixed undefined method call (underscore was missing...c'mon eslint)
